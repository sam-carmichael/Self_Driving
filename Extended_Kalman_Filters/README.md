# Extended_Kalman_Filters

In the project I complete a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. More information of project and dependancies are in the [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project)

See Extended_Kalman_Filters.pdf for more details.
