# Self-Driving

Recond the all coursework of self-driving project from Udacity

Project 1: Detect_Lane_Lines,
in the project I will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV,
more information of project and dependancies are in the [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1)

Project 2: Advanced_Lane_Lines,
in the project I write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, and I do the below points:
- Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
- Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
- Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
- Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
- Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
- Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
- Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
- Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

Project 3: Behavioral_Cloning,
in the project I used the neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior, train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

Project 4: Traffic_Sign_Classifier,
The project is the coursework of the Udacity CarND Traffic Sign Classifier Project, which I train a model to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
