# Behavioral Cloning

In the project I used the neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior, train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.
more information of project and dependancies are in the [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)
